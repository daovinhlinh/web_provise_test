This is a Flutter project that showcases a simple Recipe App. The app fetches recipe data, displays it in a user-friendly interface, and handles errors gracefully. The code is designed with readability, scalability, and maintainability in mind.

## Features

- Fetch and display a list of recipes
- Display detailed information about a recipe
- Handle loading and error states
- Pull to refresh

## Testing Strategies

We have implemented four main test cases to ensure the functionality and robustness of the app: loading, load success, load error, and refreshing. These tests are demonstrated and explained in the following videos:
