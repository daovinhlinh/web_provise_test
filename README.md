# Recipe App

This is a Flutter project that showcases a simple Recipe App. The app fetches recipe data, displays it in a user-friendly interface, and handles errors gracefully. The code is designed with readability, scalability, and maintainability in mind.

## Features

- Fetch and display a list of recipes
- Display detailed information about a recipe
- Handle loading and error states
- Pull to refresh

## Getting Started

To run this project, you need to have Flutter and Dart installed on your machine. If you haven't installed them yet, you can follow the instructions on the [Flutter website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

Once you have Flutter and Dart installed, you can follow these steps to run the project:

1. **Clone the repository**: First, you need to clone this repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/daovinhlinh/web_provise_test.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**: Use the cd command to navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd web_provise_test
   ```

3. **Get Flutter packages**: Run the following command to fetch the necessary Flutter packages:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Run the app**: Finally, you can run the app by executing the following command:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```


This will start the app in a new window.

Please note that you need to have an emulator running, or a device connected, to run the app.

## Testing Strategies

I have implemented four main test cases to ensure the functionality and robustness of the app: loading, load success, load error, and refreshing. These tests are demonstrated and explained in the following videos:
